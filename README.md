- Developed a simple command-line number guessing game using Python. 
- The game generates a random number between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess the number. 
- Feedback is provided for each guess to guide the player (too high or too low), and the total number of attempts is tracked. 
- The project demonstrates the use of control structures, input validation, loops, and random number generation.

- Key Features:
-- Random number generation using the random module
-- Real-time user input with validation
-- Loop-based guessing mechanism with attempt tracking
-- Basic error handling for non-integer inputs
